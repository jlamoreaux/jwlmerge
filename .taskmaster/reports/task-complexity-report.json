			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Project and Core Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Initialize Project and Core Dependencies' into 5 subtasks. The subtasks should cover: 1. Initializing the Next.js 14 App Router project. 2. Setting up the Git repository and making the initial commit. 3. Integrating Tailwind CSS and initializing shadcn/ui. 4. Configuring ESLint and Prettier for code quality. 5. Installing additional dependencies (Zustand, react-dropzone) and setting up Vercel Analytics/Web Vitals.",
			"reasoning": "This task has low complexity as it primarily involves running standard CLI commands and setting up boilerplate configurations. The steps are well-documented and procedural. The number of subtasks reflects the distinct tools and packages that need to be individually configured."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Build Homepage and File Upload Component",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Build Homepage and File Upload Component' into 5 subtasks. The breakdown should include: 1. Scaffolding the main homepage component and its basic layout. 2. Integrating `react-dropzone` to handle file selection and drag-and-drop events. 3. Styling the dropzone component, including instructions and animated borders for different states (e.g., drag-over). 4. Implementing the mobile-first responsive design for the entire page. 5. Adding the static content, such as the privacy statement, below the fold.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard frontend component development task with medium-low complexity. The main work involves integrating a third-party library (`react-dropzone`), managing its UI state, and ensuring the implementation is responsive. It doesn't involve complex business logic."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Client-Side File Validation and Metadata Parsing",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Client-Side File Validation and Metadata Parsing' into 6 subtasks. Focus on the client-side logic: 1. Add initial validation for file extension (`.jwlibrary`) and size (< 100MB). 2. Integrate a library like JSZip to unzip the file in the browser's memory. 3. Implement the logic to find and read the `manifest.json` file from the unzipped contents. 4. Parse the manifest JSON to extract metadata like device name and creation date. 5. Implement UI feedback for validation, showing specific error messages to the user. 6. Create a state management slice (e.g., using Zustand) to store the list of successfully validated files and their metadata.",
			"reasoning": "This task has medium complexity due to the requirement of in-browser file processing. Unzipping a file, reading its contents, and parsing them on the client side is more complex than typical form validation and requires careful handling of asynchronous operations and potential errors."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create File Management UI with Data Type Toggles",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Create File Management UI with Data Type Toggles' into 5 subtasks. The focus is on UI and state: 1. Develop a reusable `FileCard` component that accepts file metadata as props and displays it. 2. Add the data type selection checkboxes and a 'Remove' button to the `FileCard` component. 3. Implement the main UI container that renders a responsive grid of `FileCard` components based on the global file list. 4. Wire up the state management so that toggling checkboxes and clicking 'Remove' on a card updates the central Zustand store. 5. Ensure the grid layout is fully responsive, adjusting the number of columns based on screen size.",
			"reasoning": "This task has medium complexity. The core challenge is not just building the UI, but also managing the state of a dynamic list of items, where each item has its own interactive state. Ensuring this state is managed centrally and the UI is responsive requires careful planning."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Global Merge Configuration Panel",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Develop Global Merge Configuration Panel' into 5 subtasks. The focus is on global state control: 1. Create the UI for the configuration panel, including its layout and styling (e.g., sticky positioning). 2. Implement the master toggles that control the checked state of the corresponding data type across all file cards. 3. Add the 'Select All' and 'Deselect All' buttons and their associated logic to update the global state. 4. Implement the 'Start Merge' button, ensuring it is disabled until at least two files are added to the list. 5. Ensure all actions in this panel correctly update the central Zustand store, and the UI reflects these state changes.",
			"reasoning": "This task has medium-low complexity. It is primarily a UI and state management task. The logic for global controls is straightforward, but it requires careful integration with the existing global state (Zustand) to ensure it correctly synchronizes with the individual file card components."

			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Backend Infrastructure (Vercel & Supabase)",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Configure Backend Infrastructure' into 5 subtasks. The breakdown should cover: 1. Provisioning a new project in Supabase and securing the API keys. 2. Writing the SQL schema for the `merges` and `merge_stats` tables and applying it using Supabase's migration tools. 3. Setting up and configuring Vercel Blob Storage for the project. 4. Adding all necessary environment variables (Supabase URL, anon key, service role key, Blob store ID) to the Vercel project settings. 5. Creating a test Next.js API route to verify a successful connection to the Supabase database.",
			"reasoning": "This task has low complexity because it involves configuration rather than complex coding. While crucial, setting up services like Supabase and Vercel Blob is a well-defined process of following documentation, managing credentials, and running simple scripts."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Merging Logic in a Serverless Function",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Core Merging Logic' into 8 subtasks. The breakdown should detail the server-side process: 1. Create the API endpoint for the serverless function that accepts a list of file URLs and merge options. 2. Implement logic to download and unzip each `.jwlibrary` file from Vercel Blob Storage in the function's memory. 3. Develop a service to connect to the multiple `userData.db` SQLite files. 4. Implement the SQL logic to merge 'Note' records, handling potential duplicates. 5. Implement the SQL logic to merge 'Bookmark' and other data types. 6. Write logic to generate a new `manifest.json` for the merged backup. 7. Implement the final step of zipping the new `userData.db` and manifest into a new `.jwlibrary` file. 8. Upload the final archive to Vercel Blob and return its URL.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex as it represents the core business logic of the application. It involves a multi-stage data processing pipeline (download, unzip, SQL merge, zip, upload), interaction with multiple databases (SQLite), and complex data manipulation with potential for conflicts. Robust error handling is critical."

			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Frontend with Backend Merge Flow",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Integrate Frontend with Backend Merge Flow' into 7 subtasks. Focus on the end-to-end connection: 1. Develop a Next.js API route that generates a presigned URL for uploading to Vercel Blob. 2. Refactor the frontend file handling to request a presigned URL and upload the file directly to Blob storage. 3. Implement the 'Start Merge' button's onClick handler to call the backend merge function, passing the list of blob URLs and configuration. 4. Create the full-screen 'Processing' UI component. 5. Implement a client-side polling or websocket mechanism to request status updates from the backend. 6. Develop the API and client-side logic for a 'Cancel' button to stop the merge process if possible. 7. Connect the polling result to the UI, transitioning to the success/download view or an error view based on the backend's final status.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the need to orchestrate a long-running, asynchronous backend process from the client. It involves multiple, dependent API calls (presigned URL, upload, trigger, poll), complex UI state management (idle, uploading, processing, complete, error), and requires a robust solution for providing user feedback."

			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Result Download and Error Handling",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Result Download and Error Handling' into 6 subtasks. The focus is on finalization and robustness: 1. Build the 'Merge Complete' UI view, which includes a success message and a prominent download button. 2. Connect the download button to the result URL provided by the backend merge flow. 3. Implement a global toast/notification system for displaying transient messages. 4. Wire up the client-side validation logic to show user-friendly error toasts for invalid file types or sizes. 5. Add error handling to all API call sites (upload, start merge, status polling) to display relevant error messages via the toast system. 6. Design and implement a graceful failure UI state, ensuring the user is never stuck on a loading screen without feedback if the process fails.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is medium-low. While the download functionality is simple, implementing a comprehensive and user-friendly error handling strategy across the entire application is a non-trivial effort. It requires identifying all potential failure points and providing clear, consistent feedback to the user."

			"taskTitle": "Finalize UI/UX Polish and Deploy MVP",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Finalize UI/UX Polish and Deploy MVP' into 7 subtasks. The focus is on quality and release readiness: 1. Implement skeleton loaders for the main page and file grid to improve perceived performance. 2. Add subtle animations and transitions for key user interactions like adding/removing files and button presses. 3. Conduct a full accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA) and fix any identified issues with ARIA attributes, color contrast, and keyboard navigation. 4. Perform and document manual testing across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and on different device sizes. 5. Analyze the application with Lighthouse and Vercel Analytics, addressing any major performance or SEO issues. 6. Configure the Vercel project for production deployment, including all environment variables. 7. Execute the deployment pipeline and perform a post-deployment smoke test on the live URL.",
